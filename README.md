# Data Preparation
The first step involves unzipping the provided dataset and renaming it to "Netflix_shows_movies". This was done using the following Python code:

import zipfile
import os

with zipfile.ZipFile('netflix_dataset.zip', 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall('Netflix_shows_movies')

# Data Exploration
Data exploration tasks were performed to generate data descriptions and conduct statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation were computed to understand the distribution of the data.

# Data Visualization
Python libraries such as Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Pyplot were utilized to create visualizations representing the most watched genres and the distribution of ratings on Netflix. Sample code for visualization was provided in the main script file.

# R Integration
To integrate R into the analysis, the dataset was exported to a CSV file for use in R. Visualizations in R could be implemented using libraries such as ggplot2 or plotly.

# File Structure
`netflix_dataset.zip`: The compressed dataset provided for analysis.
`netflix_data.csv`: The dataset containing information about TV shows and movies on Netflix.
`netflix_data_for_R.csv`: Dataset exported for use in R.
`main_script.py`: Python script containing code for data preparation, cleaning, exploration, and visualization.
`README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.
